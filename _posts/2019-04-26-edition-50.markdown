### Support

* [Can't build first git commit](https://public-inbox.org/git/1551729517.4092.1.camel@libero.it/)

Fabio Aiuto asked for support on the Git mailing list as he was trying
to build [the first commit of Git made by Linus in April 2005](https://github.com/git/git/commit/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23),
but was getting "undefined reference to symbol" errors related to the OpenSSL library.

Santiago Torres replied suggesting him to use a toolchain from around
the time the commit was made and using an earlier OpenSSL library.

Fabio replied that he would have liked to "to debug around that simple
version, to understand how everything works".

Santiago suggested playing with libgit2, that has a smaller code base,
and its python bindings that "abstract the memory management and other
low-level stuff".

Jeff King, alias Peff, suggested linking with `-lcrypto` instead of
`-lssl` and also adding `-lz` to the Makefile or the command line.
He said that `make LIBS='-lcrypto -lz'` works for him and that he
"used periodically check that Git v1.0 can fetch happily from GitHub".

[asymptosis](https://public-inbox.org/git/20190304214829.GA573@sleipnir/)
chimed in to suggest working through
[the "Git Internals" chapter in the Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain)
to understand how Git works. He also pointed to a
[Git re-implementation as simple bash scripts](https://notabug.org/cryptarch/sgit)
he had started to understand that chapter.

Jonathan Nieder recommended reading the
[Hacking Git chapter in the user manual documentation](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#hacking-git)
that comes with Git.

Peff then reported that he managed again to build Git version 1.0.0
from December 2005 with `make NO_OPENSSL=Nope` and to use it to fetch
from GitHub.

Fabio replied that he also succeeded in building the first commit of
Git made by Linus.

Fabio, Santiago and Peff then discussed the fact that it was still
possible to build a 15 year old codebase with a modern toolchain. Peff
explained that it's possible because "Git has very few external
dependencies", and other than that, Git "just depends on a reasonable
C compiler and a POSIX libc, both of which have been standardized for
decades".

Then Fabio reported a segfault in the version he had built. Peff
reproduced it and showed how to work around it.

Fabio thanked Peff and asymptosis. He said he would "go on studying
Git this way, and follow all the improvements that were made along its
history".
