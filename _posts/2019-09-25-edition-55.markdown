## Git Rev News: Edition 55 (September 25th, 2019)

Welcome to the 55th edition of [Git Rev News](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/),
a digest of all things Git. For our goals, the archives, the way we work, and how to contribute or to
subscribe, see [the Git Rev News page](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/) on [git.github.io](http://git.github.io).

This edition covers what happened during the month of August 2019.

## Discussions

### General

* Google Summer of Code 2019 is over.

  Both students, Rohit Ashiwal and Matheus Tavares, passed their final evaluation
  and posted a final report on their blog. See:

  * [Rohit's report about improving the consistency of sequencer commands](https://rashiwal.me/2019/final-report/)

  * [Matheus' report about making pack access code thread-safe](https://matheustavares.gitlab.io/posts/gsoc-final-report)

* [Virtual Git Contributor Summit](https://public-inbox.org/git/nycvar.QRO.7.76.6.1907031429420.44@tvgsbejvaqbjf.bet/)

  Johannes Schindelin, alias Dscho, organized the first Virtual Git
  Contributor Summit which happened on Thursday September 12 and
  Friday September 13 over a Zoom call.

  [Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yp6tz_JgUYjoofTDogtosLsdykwiAyYu9yM42yTuFA4/edit)
  ([plain text](https://public-inbox.org/git/nycvar.QRO.7.76.6.1909261253400.15067@tvgsbejvaqbjf.bet/))
  have been taken and are used to organize follow up actions.

* [RFC - Git Developer Blog](https://public-inbox.org/git/20190806014935.GA26909@google.com/)

  Emily Shaffer asked on the mailing list if people would be
  interested in creating a "Git-project-blessed blog written by Git
  contributors". The goal was "to make Git better understood in the
  rest of the world", in a not very formal setting.

  A number of people replied to Emily saying that they thought it was
  a good idea, and sometimes agreeing to submit articles for the new
  blog or to review other people's submissions.

  Jeff King, who manages the git-scm.com web site, suggested hosting it
  at the same place using blog.git-scm.com, which Emily accepted.

  Following the Virtual Git Contributor Summit
  [a repository](https://gitlab.com/git-scm/blog/)
  has been created for the blog by James Ramsay.

* [diff.renames not working?](https://public-inbox.org/git/CAHd499BT35jvPtsuD9gfJB0HJ=NxtzyQOaiD7-=sHJbFYhphpg@mail.gmail.com/)

  Robert Dailey wondered if the `diff.renames` config option worked
  correctly when it's set to `copies`, as `git diff --name-status` and
  `git diff --follow` (which is not documented) showed that one file
  was copied from another when they were passed a path to a file as
  argument, but `git diff` and `git diff -M` didn't.

  Jeff King, alias Peff, replied to Robert explaining how rename
  detection works and what are the current limitations. He also
  suggested some possible improvements.

  Bryan Turner and Peff also noticed that `-M` detects renames, not
  copies.

  Junio agreed with Peff and gave extra historical information and
  also discussed possible improvements.

## Developer Spotlight: Emily Shaffer

* Who are you and what do you do?

  I'm a California resident, dog mom, maker, and software engineer at
  Google contributing to Git as my day job!

* What would you name your most important contribution to Git?

  [The My First Contribution tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/MyFirstContribution.html) -
  it's helping folks who are interested in committing to Git full-time
  figure out how to write and send patches, and more importantly (to
  me), it has launched a conversation about better internal
  documentation for Git contributors, which I'm really excited about.

* What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?

  Lately, I've been making it easier for the Git team at Google to
  distribute Git to Googlers (gee). For the benefit of the broader
  community, I have started working on a tool to help users generate
  helpful, actionable bug reports. Soon I hope to be doing some work
  with hook management.

* If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?

  Submodules! I think they're such a cool idea but they have a long
  way to go right now. It's a little personal for me; I also
  contribute to [OpenBMC](https://openbmc.org) which I think could benefit a
  lot from using submodules as well, but it hasn't been feasible yet.

* If you could remove something from Git without worrying about
  backwards compatibility, what would it be?

  That's a good question! There are lots of depths of Git that I
  haven't been subjected to yet, so I think I have to do some more
  homework before I can decide what I'd do away with.

* What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git itself?

  Probably the high number of tiny `.bashrc` aliases I've got for the
  Git CLI. My work would be much slower without quick aliases for
  `git grep`, `git format-patch`, and so on. Or, I suppose related to the
  Git project (but not the Git tool), I learned to use mutt for
  interacting with the Git mailing list and am still thrilled to be
  able to email in Vim.
