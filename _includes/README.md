# About Git Developer Pages

This is a website to help Git Developers.

It is NOT a place to discuss Git issues. Please see
[git-scm.org's community page](https://git-scm.com/community)
for information about bug reporting or interacting with the
community.

The pages are maintained by editing files in the
[git/git.github.io](https://github.com/git/git.github.io) repository on
GitHub. It is then published on the
[https://git.github.io](https://git.github.io) GitHub page.

It is meant to be edited collaboratively like a wiki, except that
instead of a web form, you get to use a text editor and Git. What could
be better?

These pages also host the [Git Rev News](https://git.github.io/rev_news/),
see the [About Git Rev News](https://git.github.io/rev_news/rev_news/) page.

If you want push access, contact Christian Couder
< <christian.couder@gmail.com> > or Taylor Blau < <me@ttaylorr.com> > and
provide your GitHub username. You may also send patches by mail (and
feel free to cc git@vger.kernel.org if appropriate).
