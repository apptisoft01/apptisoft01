title: Hacking Git
---

The goal of this document is not to be a tutorial, but rather to
point to interesting material that has already been written.

The goal is also not to list all the articles about Git or its
internals. There are a lot of good resources, including free
[books](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/), about that elsewhere.

Contributions are welcome though! Please contact us on the Git Mailing
list (at [git@vger.kernel.org](mailto:git@vger.kernel.org)) or open an
issue or a pull request on our
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/git/git.github.io/) to discuss or
suggest improvements. Thanks!
