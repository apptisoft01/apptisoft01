title: General Application Information
---

This is the page where people who want to apply to the Git project for
the Google Summer of Code (GSoC), Outreachy, or other such mentoring
programs can get information about what the Git project would like to
see in an application.

*Please read this page completely before focusing on a project or a
 microproject ideas, or microproject general information.*


## Microproject (required)

It is required that applicants who want to apply to the Git
project for the GSoC or Outreachy complete a tiny, code-related
"microproject" as part of their application. Please refer to our
[general guidelines and suggestions for microprojects](https://git.github.io/General-Microproject-Information)
for more information. Completing a microproject is not only an important
way for us to get experience with applicants, but it will also help
applicants become familiar with Git's development and submission
process.

## Reviewing (not required but appreciated)

Also, working in Git project is not only about writing your own
patches. Constructively critiquing design and implementation of
patches by other people is also an important skill you need to learn
in order to effectively collaborate with others. So, if you have time
and inclination, it would be beneficial to read and understand other
applicants' patches (or any other patch submitted to the mailing-list),
think if you agree that the problem they are trying to solve is worth
solving, the approach they are taking is the best way (or if you think
of a better way to solve it), etc., and respond to their patches with
the result of your thinking as a review.

## Application (required)

A complete application should include a presentation of yourself
(include any argument that may convince mentors that you are able to
complete the project) and detailed explanations about your
project. See also the "Note about giving back and mentoring" below.

Project ideas are just ... ideas! The list we provide is not
exhaustive, and more importantly each idea only includes a summary of
what is to be done. An application must include detailed plans on the
design, timeline ...  A typical application takes several pages.

If you are applying for the GSoC, you should already have read
[the GSoC Contributor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal)
by now, but re-read it if needed.

If you are applying for Outreachy there is very likely similar
documentation on their web site that you should follow.

Please, include link(s) to the mailing-list discussion(s) related to
your microproject in your application (e.g. linking to
[lore.kernel.org](https://lore.kernel.org/git/)). If you participate
in the review of other patches, then you may also include links to
discussions that would support your application. Please also describe
the status of the patches you have sent and maybe reviewed: Have they
been merged already in an official branch maintained by Junio? What
does [Junio's "What's cooking in git.git" emails](https://lore.kernel.org/git/?q=s%3A%22What%27s+cooking+in+git.git%22)
say about it? In general it's a good idea to describe all your Git
related work so far with a good amount of detail.

Applicants must send drafts of their proposal on the mailing-list
before submitting it officially to GSoC or Outreachy to get feedback
from the community. They are strongly encouraged to publish a draft on
the official GSoC or Outreachy website *and* post it to the mailing
list for discussion.

Getting your proposal right can follow the same process as usual patch
submission for Git, as described in the
[microprojects](https://git.github.io/General-Microproject-Information) page and
in `Documentation/SubmittingPatches` in Git's source code. It is also
expected that you will send several versions of your draft, responding
to comments on the list. Please plan to send the first draft early
enough so that a number of reviews and improvements cycles can happen.

If you are not sure about your proposal, you can discuss that in the
same email where you introduce yourself or in separate emails. Please
use "[GSoC]" or "[Outreachy]" at the beginning of the subject of such
emails.

## Summary

In summary, all applicants must (not necessarily in this order):

* Complete a [microproject](https://git.github.io/General-Microproject-Information).

* Write a detailed application explaining their project.

* Discuss their project by posting drafts of their application on the
  mailing-list long before the deadline. See the "Note about getting
  involved early" below.

In your application, and in the discussions related to projects you
are interested in, it is a good idea to:

* Include link(s) to the mailing-list discussion(s) related to the
  project you chose in your application or you are interested in, for
  example previous discussions or patch series about the topic. There
  might be interesting discussions about the topics that are several
  year old. It is also a good idea to summarize them.

* Include link(s) to the mailing-list discussion(s) related to the
  previous drafts of your application itself.

* Include link(s) to the mailing-list discussion(s) related to your
  microproject. If your microproject patches have been merged, please
  give the merge commits. Otherwise give their branch names and
  current status in the last "What's cooking in git.git" email from
  Junio.

* Include what is suggested in
  [the GSoC Contributor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal)
  or the equivalent guidelines for Outreachy.

([lore.kernel.org](https://lore.kernel.org/git/) can be
used for searching the mailing list and linking to previous
discussions.)

## Note about the number of slots

The Git organization usually has very limited mentoring capacity.
These days we usually accept around 2 or 3 students per season
(Winter or Summer).

## Note about giving back and mentoring

We appreciate very much students and interns who stay around after the
mentoring period is over. It is very nice to see them on the mailing
list, even if they don't contribute much. It's of course better when
they continue to contribute though, even by just reviewing a patch
from time to time.

Some people have been around for more than 10 years, others have
become regular contributors and that's great!

One very nice way to contribute and to give back is to mentor or
co-mentor other students or interns coming after you. It helps create
more opportunities for more students and interns like you, as
mentoring capacity is the main factor preventing us from accepting
more students and interns. If each student or intern accepted to
co-mentor twice (for example once in Summer and once in Winter) just
after they have been mentored, our mentoring capacity could increase
significantly each year.

Even though successful former students/interns usually have adequate
technical ability to be a successful mentor, unfortunately few of them
have been willing to just co-mentor once along with an experienced
mentor.

Other free or open source projects have done better than us on
this. At the Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit for example, more
than 30% of the mentors were former students.

Here is a quote by a mentor (Carlos Fernandez Sanz) on the GSoC
Mentors List, that describes very well how we see GSoC and Outreachy:

"GSoC is (for us, anyway) more about growing the community than
getting stuff done. If they don't stick around their value diminishes
a lot, even if they do a great job [...]. The students that did a
great job but completely left the community [...] are just a memory...
the ones that have been with us and that are now mentors [...], long
after they participated in GSoC, are the ones we love :-)"

Consider showing us in your application previous mentoring, giving
back and community activities that you have done, especially related
to free or open source software.

## Note about refactoring projects versus projects that implement new features

Over the years we have been favoring refactoring projects over
possibly more interesting projects that implement new features.
Refactoring projects are usually easier to do step by step, and to get
code merged step by step which is encouraging.

In general refactoring projects are worthwhile to do even if the
project is not finished at the end of the GSoC and even if the student
or intern stops contributing after that. In those cases it is often a
good idea to later finish the refactoring either by ourselves or by
proposing it to another GSoC student or Outreachy intern. This way the
work of both students and mentors is not likely to be wasted.

With a project that implements a feature, there is a risk, if it's too
complex or too difficult, that the feature will not be finished and
that nothing, or nearly nothing, will have been merged during the GSoC
or Outreachy internship. There is also the risk that another way to
implement the feature will appear later in the GSoC or Outreachy
internship, and all, or nearly all, the work of the student or intern
and mentors will have been mostly wasted. It could also appear that
the use cases the feature was envisioned to be used in, are better
addressed by other improvements or a different workflow.

Another potential issue is that a new feature might be prone to naming
or user interface discussions which could last for a long time or
could not result in clear decisions.

Therefore we think that we should be very careful before proposing to
an applicant, or accepting, a project that implements a new feature.
People suggesting such a project should at least carefully consider
the above potential issues and see if they can be mitigated before the
project is submitted.

As [suggested by Google](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/defining-a-project-ideas-list)
(but this is true for Outreachy internships too), we emphasize that an
applicant proposing something original must engage with the community
strongly before and during the application period to get feedback and
guidance to improve the proposal and avoid the above potential issues.

## Note about getting involved early

The process of reviewing microproject patches and applications on the
mailing list can take a lot of time. Depending on your experience and
the tools you are already familiar with or not, it can also take some
time to set up and get used to properly sending emails and patches to
the mailing list, interacting with people on the mailing list, reading
the documentation, getting used to the code base, etc. That's why we
strongly suggest getting involved very early, like several months,
before the deadline.

The more we can see that you invest in learning and participating in
Git's development, the more we can be confident that you are motivated
and will likely stay in the community.

This doesn't necessarily mean that you have no chance at all of
getting accepted if you get involved quite late. It depends on how
other applicants are doing and how many available mentors we have or
can find. But anyway you start with a significant handicap compared to
other applicants who got involved early.

It might therefore be a good idea to find a project idea that is not
yet being pursued by an applicant who started getting involved much
earlier than you. This means that you might have to find a project
idea that we haven't proposed in our idea list.

The good side of this is that this project idea along with your
enthousiasm for it and the skills you show might encourage Git
developers to mentor you even if they weren't planning to mentor in
the first place. It could also happen that someone, who was only
planning to co-mentor, could agree to fully mentor you alone.
